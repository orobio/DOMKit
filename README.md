# DOMKit

Swift framework to interact with the DOM in the browser.

**Note**: This project is experimental and far from complete. Only a small part of the DOM APIs is implemented.
For a more complete project (but also experimental), have a look at: [swiftwasm/DOMKit](https://github.com/swiftwasm/DOMKit)
